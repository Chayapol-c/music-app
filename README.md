# Android Music App

modern android application implemented from [
The Complete Android 14 & Kotlin Development Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/android-kotlin-developer/)
course material project

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Navigate through each page by bottom menu
- Open the setting bottomsheet by kebab menu (top right)
- Open the drawer by account menu (top left)

## My process

### Built with
- androidx compose material
- androidx navigation compose


and more dependencies and their version in [here](https://github.com/Chayapol-c/music-app/blob/main/gradle/libs.versions.toml)

### Useful resource

- [Android Jetpack Compose and Atomic Design](https://betterprogramming.pub/android-jetpack-compose-and-atomic-design-1395502c5c05) - this blog inspired me to apply atomic design to jetpack compose ui

### What I learned

- Navigation in compose
- Implement Scaffold Composable with topbar, bottombar, and drawer
- Implement BottomNavigation
